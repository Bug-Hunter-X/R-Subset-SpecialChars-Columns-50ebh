This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when subsetting data frames in R using column names that include special characters like hyphens or periods.  The `bug.r` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.r` provides the corrected approach.  The issue arises from R's handling of non-standard column names, particularly when using the standard subsetting approach `df[, cols_to_select]`. The solution uses backticks to properly select columns with special characters.
